# Halima courses

This website creates awareness about various courses that Hlima offers.

## Available scripts

The scripts that I used to run this website are

### `npm run start`

It starts the website in the development enviroment. Basically creates a local server where my website runs on during development.

### `npm run build`

The script buils the website ready for shipment. It complies the code, cancatenates the stylesheets I used and compresses them into a minified file.
